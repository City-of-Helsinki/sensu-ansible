# Testing
A small testing framework is provided with this role using [Vagrant](https://vagrantup.com/).  

To test this role locally, once you've set up Vagrant, simply `cd` to `tests` and run `vagrant up [ubuntu15|centos7]`, after which you can visit the following URLs in your browser for the associated deployments:  

- Ubuntu 15.04: `http://localhost:3000`
- CentOS 7: `http://localhost:3001`

_Note: To test SmartOS, please simply roll out a base64 zone_  

To log in, use `admin` as both the username & password.  


As support for other operating systems/distributions is written, they will be added as options for testing.

## Caveats
### Failing handlers
It is expected that the following two handlers, triggered at the end of the test run will fail:  

- `restart sensu-server service`
- `restart sensu-api service`

Both these handlers use the `delegate_to` directive, which does not play nice with Vagrant.  
This __is__ expected to work in real deployments.

### Malformed Vagrant inventory
The inventory file generated by Vagrant may be prone to clashes when spinning up test VMs, as both the Ubuntu & CentOS Vagrant files have their VMs listed in the same groups.  
This will usually be exhibited by failing tasks which require inventory fact lookups, so expect to see failures when doing index lookups against host groups.  
A temporary workaround is to remove the inventory file generated by Vagrant: `$ rm -f .vagrant/provisioners/ansible/inventory/vagrant_ansible_inventory`
