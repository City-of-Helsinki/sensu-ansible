# A few words from the author
Well, thanks for bothering to even visit this page!

This role was born out of my own passion for the absolutely excellent projects that it uses.
I figure I have to list them, in no particular order, here they are. __Make sure to check them all out!__

- [Ansible](http://ansible.com/home)
- [Sensu](https://sensuapp.org/)
- [Uchiwa](https://uchiwa.io/#/)
- [SmartOS](https://smartos.org/)
- [RabbitMQ](https://rabbitmq.com/)
- [Redis](http://redis.io/)

## What about support for other operating systems?
It's planned! I've done development for this role entirely on [SmartOS](https://smartos.org/).
It makes development fast, easy, and cheap! Just a few reasons it really is the perfect operating system ;)

I've already started support for OpenBSD, other BSDs and some Linuxes will follow, notably:

- FreeBSD
- NetBSD
- EL
- Ubuntu/Debian

I'd be happy to add any others to the list if high demand shows.

## About updates
This is a personal project of mine that I work on in my own free time.
Most of the real "meat" is there, I just need to restructure and implement conditional includes based on facts.

That said, I'm a busy man! And when I do get time, all development takes place on [a little HP microserver](http://drentheweer.nl/img/hpn54l.png)... which, when straying from [Zones](https://wiki.smartos.org/display/DOC/Zones), can get a little sluggish.

So please, [bear with me](http://i.imgur.com/bGhY7oX.jpg). I'll happily accept any contributions, both in [additions to the code](https://github.com/cmacrae/ansible-sensu/pulls), and any [bug reports](https://github.com/cmacrae/ansible-sensu/issues) :)

## If you like it
Share it! Get it out there; link it all over the place!
It's not just about awesome deployment, it's about exposing people to excellent open source software!
